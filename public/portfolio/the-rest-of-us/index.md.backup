##### Fall 23  
##### Prototype 2  

In this sci-fi styled project the player shoots a ball down a rotating tech tube that has spinning bricks. Utilizing hand tracking through the Ultra Leap, the player moves their hand to destroy the bricks. When the player destroys the bricks, more spawn in for the player to face and continuously loops until the player loses.
