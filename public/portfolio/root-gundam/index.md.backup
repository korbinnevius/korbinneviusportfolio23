Inspired by the prompt of *Roots* for the Global Game Jam 2023 and the shared desire of making a bullet hell type game with my group, we went on to create Root Gundam. 

This is a game where you are the embodiment of technology and your mission is to eliminate the last pillar of nature. 

With the help of Lane Macy and Ethan Derstine we were able to create this concept of a game where you dash around avoiding vines (projectiles) while shooting at the boss, Mr.T.

I worked on the character movement script provided by [otoolew](https://github.com/otoolew/Merc) and his help. I also created the win state screens and damage parts of the game.

Lane designed the logic behind the shooting vines which includes range, frequency, and orientation.

Ethan created all of the sprites, animations, and sound sin the game.
