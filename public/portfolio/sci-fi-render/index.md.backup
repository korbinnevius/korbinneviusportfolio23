First project that I rendered in Houdini. I made the model in Blender with the [RandomFlow](https://blenderguppy.gumroad.com/l/randomflow) add-on by Blender Guppy. I then transitioned the model into Houdini for fixing the UVs. After, I transitioned to Substance Painter in order to texture everything and then finally moving back to Houdini to render in Solaris.
