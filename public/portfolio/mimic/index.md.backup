My first sculpt using Mudbox in tandem with Maya. I created this with the guidance of someone creating their own character. I utilized the core ideas they presented me while adjusting them to fit the image that I was going for. 

Still learning to rig and animate the model, more images/videos to come! Also looking to paint the model and make it game ready!
