Utilizing the tangram add-on and looking glass device as well as software, I was able to create a project where a city would generate and be displayed on the Looking Glass.

The tangram add-on provides you an API key to generate map data based on the coordinates given to it. This includes data such as bodies of water, land, and buildings. The generated objects are fully customizable in terms of materials.  

Through Unity, you can record a quilt from the game view of the generated product that can then be put onto the Looking Glass and displayed in 3D.
