      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through this project we are using virtual reality technologies to deliver experiences where Chatham students can interact “directly” with these extremely rare and typically inaccessible discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to bring this experience into a classroom setting for students to experience what a fossil site would like. Through comparing individual close up, high resolution models, to where they would be located in the site, you can learn more details than you woulds in a picture. You can also manipulate the fossil site itself with both joysticks and the levers on the table.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
