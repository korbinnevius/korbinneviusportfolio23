      <description>&lt;p&gt;Above is an illustrated version of my puppy, Mia, made in Adobe Illustrator. As I have been expanding my knowledge in Adobe Products, I have been looking to create electronic art of things in my life I appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Utilized a mix of adobe products, Illustrator and Photoshop, to create a design and mock-ups for the JED Organization. Gave me the opportunity to create a new logo for an organization I support for free. I was also able to be exposed to a new use of photoshop, mockups. This allowed me to create professional images utilizing my newly created logo on products such as business cards, a website, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
