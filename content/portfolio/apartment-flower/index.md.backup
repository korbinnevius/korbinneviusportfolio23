My first big Blender project where I created everything on my own. I followed Ian Huberts lazy tutorial (tutorial) for the quick city and I used the magnolia flower I made while learning about UV mapping from another tutorial (tutorial).  

My favorite part of the tutorial is how the flower sits in the glass vase filled with water. Some cools elements of the project is that an image of the moon provided by NASA is UV mapped to the moon and I have multiple light sources reflecting off the windows.  

This was my first step in creating bigger projects on my own and is currently still one of my favorite creations now.
