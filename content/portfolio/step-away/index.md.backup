Inspired by the idea of wanting to get away from all of the stress and responsibilities of your daily life, Step-Away was idea me and my group decided on for our final project of one of our Immersive Media (IMM) class. I worked with Lane Macy and Malik George who made the light adjuster and radio respectively.

This is a collaborative environment where you play around and solve a puzzle cube located on the table in front of you while being able to adjust the lighting and music of the scene. 

You are being called by your family to go and help while in the middle of your work. You decide your exhausted and want to mess around with the variety of items around the room instead to ease your stress. 

I modeled, animated, and worked on the cube puzzle which is what the other interactions set the environment for solving.

Other than the other interactable objects, I created most of the other models used in the scene. These include the door, table, couch, apartment, computer, and city outside the window.
