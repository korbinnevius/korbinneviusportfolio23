Typography project where we picked a typographer and made a pamphlet using their type and including a brief description of them.  

The design of the final poster was inspired by Neville Brody's book *The Graphic Language of Neville Brody 3*.  

The other two posters that I made for Neville Brody were:  
![ff Tyson](/images/portfolio/typography-pamphlet/nevius-three-merge-02.png)  
![Dirty One](/images/portfolio/typography-pamphlet/nevius-three-merge-03.png)  

The ff Tyson poster was inspired by the fight poster Brody designed for Mike Tyson's matches. The poster using the Dirty One Font was inspired by the graphic Brody made for Coca-Cola.
