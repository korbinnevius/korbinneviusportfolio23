Throughout my internship at Clocky I rendered out multiple variations of colors and clock styles to showcase how that clock would look like. In order to accomplish this, I needed to work on improving the realism and quality of my renders. At first it started with a simple camera angle and render of the Clocky. As I improved with my rendering and learning how to utilize software such as Arnold and Hypershade, I was able to constantly improve my render quality. Pair this up with Photoshop I was also able to make slight tweaks and change the background. 

There were a total of 4 different angles and 6 different colors that needed to be rendered out. Over the duration of my internship, the renders changed depending on feedback. This included factors such as color, lighting, angle, and background. 

An example of a color that has gone through revisions and has final renders that I completed in multiple angles as well as a packaging render.
