**Having complications adding the final video**

Through this project I am learning to make a visual music video in Unity by utilizing the HDRP scene template. Through this project I have learned to utilize the Cinemachine camera system, unity recorder, timeline, and Premier to develop a new workflow designed for video editing.  

The goal of this project is to develop a music video that tells a story using a song of my choice and the Unity software. I learned about basic video editing in Adobe Premier as well as the [Lasp-VFX](https://github.com/keijiro/LaspVfx) tool by Keijiro. Early design was through multiple storyboards to block out the general ideas that wanted to act on.

This led me to creating a multitude of scenes for each important shot sequence. Then recording each individual scene organized by the Unity timeline.

The idea behind the story is that someone is imagining the ghost of someone and is running after them. The difficulties behind the creation of this project lies within the limited time and resources available. We had 6 weeks to research, storyboard, block out, and learn the new Unity features on top of Adobe Premier. Due to this I did not have time to create my own models or animation so I was limited to what was available on *Make Human* and *Mixamo*. This is especially prevalent at the end of the music video when the same dance is repeated as I couldn't find anything else to align with my original idea. This idea was that they would be moving throughout the forest jumping around and interacting with the environment.   

A production complication that wasn't the result of limited models was the time displacement on record. Whenever the recording started, the music would be delayed and the VFX was reliant on the audio. This made the VFX and audio out of sync instead of coinciding together.
