Through this project we are using virtual reality technologies to deliver experiences where Chatham students can interact “directly” with these extremely rare and typically inaccessible discoveries.  

The goal of this project is to bring this experience into a classroom setting for students to experience what a fossil site would like. Through comparing individual close up, high resolution models, to where they would be located in the site, you can learn more details than you woulds in a picture. You can also manipulate the fossil site itself with both joysticks and the levers on the table.

The experience also contains no sound so that you can hear the instructor walk you through the process.  

On the map you can view and interact with the site locations and see where they would be located on a map.

Once you select a location, you can view the close up models that appear on the table and interact with them.

Throughout the entire experience if you ever forget what the controls are, you have an image to easily remember everything.
